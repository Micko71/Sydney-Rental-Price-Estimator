# Sydney rental price estimator
This app uses a linear regression model to estimate Sydney rental prices based on location and selected property features.

The model used was trained on data scraped from a popular real estate site. The data was split 70:30 into training and test sets and the resulting model achieved an adjusted Rsquared of 0.67 meaning that 67% of the variance in rental prices can be explained by the model inputs.

The purpose of this project was to go through the complete process of scraping data from the web, cleaning the data, creating a predictive model with the data and deploying this model in a web application.
